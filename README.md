# Machine_Learning on CutCorner
This repository is specifically for Machine_Learning in the CutCorner project.

# Description
Based on our exploration, we will implement a machine learning model to our product feature that is determine shape of customer face and barbershop recommendation. The shape of customer face used as a basis for determining haircut recommendations. While, the barbershop recommendation is based on rating. The model will be constructed using from TensorFlow Library. The tools we use to create models and training models are Jupyter Notebook. The libraries used include TensorFlow, Sklearn, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and Scikit-Image. The trained model will be deployed as a mobile application using TFLite for production. Dataset dataset we use is from kaggle that we do preprocessing such as spliing data, feature selection, and select other possible learning model. The model form is a built-in modelselection, and select other possible learning model

# Project Scope
- Machine Learning application to determine the shape of customer face and barbershop recommendation
- Using fix dataset from kaggle and Google Rating API
- Determine the face into 5 shapes (square, heart, oval, oblong, round)
- Haircut recommendation using dataset from tiktok filter
- Barbershop recommendation based on location and rating

# Machine Learing Output Feature
1. AI CutCorner : Hairstyle Recommendation based on the shape of customer face
2. Barbershop Recommendation : Based on location and rating
